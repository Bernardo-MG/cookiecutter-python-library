===============================

This is a project created with the `Cookiecutter Python Library
<https://github.com/Bernardo-MG/cookiecutter-python-library>`_ template and
ready to be used for creating a new Python library.

Just check the readme and docs, to adapt them to your project, and it is done.

Remember that if you want to create a new project it is better just reusing
the Cookiecutter Python Library template, as this will set up the initial
project according to a few pieces of data it will ask for.

Features
--------

- Github Workflow configuration file
- Customized setup.py module to minimize configuration, and using tox for the tests
- Docs using `Sphinx`_ and the `Sphinx Docs Theme <https://github.com/Bernardo-MG/sphinx-docs-theme>`_
- Prepared to run tests through tox
- Prepared to run tests on Python 2 and 3
- Prepared to run tests on pypy and pypy 3
- Prepared to run tests for the `Sphinx`_ documentation

Documentation
-------------

Documentation sources are included with the project, and used to generate the
documentation sites:

- The `latest docs`_ are always generated for the latest release, kept in the 'master' branch
- The `development docs`_ are generated from the latest code in the 'develop' branch

The source files for the docs, a small `Sphinx`_ project, are kept in the 'docs folder.

These can be built if needed:

``python setup.py build_docs``

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Dependencies are indicated on the requirements.txt file.

These can be installed with:

``pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt``

Installing
~~~~~~~~~~

The project is offered as a `Pypi package`_, and using pip is the preferred way
to install it. For this use the following command;

``pip install {{ cookiecutter.package_name }}``

If needed, manual installation is possible:

``python setup.py install``

Usage
-----

The application has been coded in Python, and does not require any particular
framework.

Testing
-------

The tests included with the project can be run with:

``python setup.py test``

This will delegate the execution to tox.

It is possible to run just one of the test profiles, in this case the py36 profile:

``python setup.py test -p "py3.8"``

Collaborate
-----------

Any kind of help with the project will be well received, and there are two main ways to give such help:

- Reporting errors and asking for extensions through the issues management
- or forking the repository and extending the project

Issues management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Issues are managed at the GitHub `project issues tracker`_, where any Github
user may report bugs or ask for new features.

Getting the code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you wish to fork or modify the code, visit the `GitHub project page`_, where
the latest versions are always kept. Check the 'master' branch for the latest
release, and the 'develop' for the current, and stable, development version.
