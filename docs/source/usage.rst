First of all, Cookiecutter must be installed on the computer:

.. code-block:: sh

    $ pip install cookiecutter

Then, the template can be acquired and used directly from Github:

.. code-block:: sh

    $ cookiecutter gh:bernardo-mg/cookiecutter-python-library

It is only needed to download the template once. After that, it can be reused:

.. code-block:: sh

    $ cookiecutter cookiecutter-python-library/

After that, just follow the instructions.
