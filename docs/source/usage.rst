Usage
=====

This project requires the use of `Cookiecutter`_, which can be installed with
the help of pip:

.. code-block:: sh

    $ pip install cookiecutter

After that the template can be acquired and used directly from Github:

.. code-block:: sh

    $ cookiecutter gh:bernardo-mg/cookiecutter-python-library

As it is only required to download the template once it can be reused this way:

.. code-block:: sh

    $ cookiecutter cookiecutter-python-library/

Once the command has been executed just follow the instructions which will
appear on the screen, asking for some information to fill the project template.
