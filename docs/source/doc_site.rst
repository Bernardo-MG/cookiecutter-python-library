==================
Documentation site
==================

The `Sphinx`_ folder contains basic files to generate a Sphinx documentation
site.

There is little to add which can't be found on the Sphinx site, apart from the
fact that the `Sphinx Docs Theme`_ template has been used for the UI look.

------------
Docs command
------------

The following command generates the docs:

.. code-block:: sh

    $ python setup.py build_docs

They will be available inside the build folder.

.. _Sphinx: http://sphinx-doc.org/
.. _Sphinx Docs Theme: https://github.com/Bernardo-MG/sphinx-docs-theme
