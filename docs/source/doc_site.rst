==================
Documentation site
==================

The 'doc' folder contains basic files to generate a Sphinx documentation site.
Of course, Sphinx can be used to create other kinds of docs, but combined with
`ReadTheDocs <https://readthedocs.org/>`_ it is possible to have an always
accessible documentation site, which will look similar to this one.

There is little to add which can't be found on the Sphinx site, apart from the
fact that the Bootstrap template has been used for the UI look.

The only noticeable addition is the status sidebar, with several shields, which
give visual information about the current situation of the project. Remove from
that list all those services you won't be using.
