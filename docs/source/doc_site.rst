==================
Documentation site
==================

The `Sphinx`_ folder contains basic files to generate a Sphinx documentation
site. Of course, Sphinx can be used to create other kinds of docs, but combined
with `ReadTheDocs`_ it is possible to have an always accessible documentation
site, which will look similar to this one.

There is little to add which can't be found on the Sphinx site, apart from the
fact that the `Sphinx Docs Theme`_ template has been used for the UI look.
